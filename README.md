Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Diabetes Care

This project explores the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop personalized treatment  The goal is to create an intelligent agent that can recommend optimal insulin dosages based on a patient's glucose levels and historical data.
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook with the complete code for data preprocessing, environment setup, agent training (using PPO and DQN algorithms)

Getting Started

To run this project, you can use Google Colab, which provides a free, cloud-based environment with all the necessary libraries pre-installed.

Prerequisites

•	A Google Account to access Google Colab.
•	The diabetes-data.zip dataset file.

Opening the Notebook in Google Colab

1.	Navigate to Google Colab.   
2.	Click on File -> Open notebook.   
3.	In the pop-up window, select the GitHub tab.
4.	Enter the URL of this repository: https://github.com/shayshankr/Reinforcement-Learning-for-Personalized-Diabetes-Care
5.	Select the code_sr.ipynb notebook to open it.
   
Inserting the Dataset

The notebook requires the diabetes-data.zip file to be present in the Colab environment.

1.	In the open Colab notebook, locate the file browser on the left-hand side.
2.	Click on the "Upload to session storage" icon (a file icon with an upward arrow).
3.	Select the diabetes-data.zip file from your local machine to upload it.
4.	Important: The notebook expects the file to be at the path /content/diabetes-data.zip. Ensure the file is uploaded to the root /content/ directory.
   
How to Run the Code

Once the notebook is open and the dataset is uploaded, you can run the code cells sequentially.
